      <h1>How to Play Blockchain Connect4</h1>
      
      <div className="howto-section">
        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Connect4 is a classic two-player connection game where players take turns dropping colored discs
          into a vertically suspended 7Ã—6 grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, 
          vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This blockchain version maintains all the rules of the traditional game, with the added security 
          and transparency of blockchain technology.

        <h2>Game Features</h2>
        <h3>Game Dashboard:</h3>
        <p>
          The dashboard shows important information about the current game:
        </p>
        <ul>

        <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
        <p>
          The game can end in three ways:

          <li><strong>Timeout Win</strong>: Your opponent fails to make a move within the timeout period</li>
          <li><strong>Draw</strong>: The board is filled completely with no four-in-a-row formed</li>

      </div>

      <div className="howto-section">
        <h2>Blockchain Aspects</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike traditional online games, this blockchain implementation has unique characteristics:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each move requires a blockchain transaction and gas fee</li>
          <li>Transactions need time to be mined (usually 5-30 seconds)</li>
          <li>All game rules are enforced by the smart contract, not a central server</li>
          <li>Game history is permanently recorded on the blockchain</li>
          <li>The game state cannot be manipulated or hacked</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
